# AIAgentToonBlast
That is a Reinforcement Learning POC project for me I cloned the game mechanics of Toon Blast from Peak Games and created an RL AI Agent 

Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è Project Status
This is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) demonstrating core concepts. Current limitations include:

Occasional animation freezes during large combos
Simplified scoring vs. the commercial game
Basic visual effects compared to original

üìú Legal Disclaimer
This project is:
A fan-created copycat of Toon Blast mechanics
Not affiliated with Peak Games/Zynga
For educational/demonstration purposes only

üß† Model Training Context
The included AI model (best_model.pth):

Was trained exclusively on this simplified implementation
May not work with official Toon Blast
Focuses on basic patterns (not advanced strategies)
Full Revision to Key Features Section

‚úÖ Smart AI Agent

Trained using Deep Q-Learning (DQN)
MVP-level performance (demonstrates core competency)
Current limitations:
Sometimes prioritizes short-term rewards
Can get stuck in repetitive patterns
Struggles with complex box-clearing scenarios
‚úÖ Simplified Clone

Implements basic Toon Blast mechanics
Not feature-complete vs. commercial version
Focused on demonstrating AI/RL integration


Sample AI played game(sometimes stucks):
